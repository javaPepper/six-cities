# Six Cities
---

### Description
---

Welcome to Six Cities!

Six Cities is the "pen test" on my way of learning javascript and React. Other words it is the first and educational project that's made under the supervision of the mentor.

---

Whereas Six Cities is an educational project this repo consists of some logical implementations only. HTML markup and CSS styles as well as backend portions are delivered "out of the box".
