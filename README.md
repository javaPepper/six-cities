# Six Cities
---

### Description
---

Welcome to Six Cities!

Six Cities is the "pen test" on my way of learning javascript and React. Other words it is the first and educational project that's made under supervision of the mentor.

---

Whereas Six Cities is a educational project this repo consits some logical implementations only. HTML layouts and CSS styles as well as backend portions are delivered "out of the box".
